      "solution": [
        {"id": 0, "paragraph": "This project developed over a 5 months period with financial support from an angel investor and Berklee ICE. When the Facebook Messenger platform opened and after frustrating personal experiences with ticket purchases, we saw the opportunity of simplifying ticket discovery and purchase via a chat interface. In fact, current ticketing platforms such as Ticketmaster or Axs are slow and complicated without great mobile first experiences forcing third party apps such as Songkick and Bandsintown to appear. A seamless experience would require a complete redesign."},
        {"id": 1, "paragraph": "We leveraged Messenger platform functionalities such as location, quick replies, template cards and integrated payment system to create a fluid experience. We first build a small script to identify the users’ favorite artists playing in their geographic area. We also implemented an integrated ticket query via Ticketmaster followed by the option to finish the purchase. As our friends started using it we gradually added features such as concert recommendations based on influent music publications and search of similar artists etc. Through the development I got to develop stronger backend Javascript skills using complex concepts such as asynchronous promises to connect all the different APIs together smoothly."}

      "conclusion": "The venture side of the project gradually developed as our friends were gaining interest and became beta users. We looked into monetization options but we weren’t able to prototype any without requiring greater infrastructure or deals with major ticket sellers. Hence we approached VCs and other angel investors who showed a great deal of curiosity towards chatbots at the time. In fact we were able to arrange a dozen of meetings most notably with Bessemer VP partner Kent Bennett who gave a huge amount of insight on our potential markets. It turns out this case study was still very niche (our friends are college students/ music nerds). Nevertheless, it was probably one of the best lesson in building the perfect pitch deck and investor pitch. We also connected with one of the Napster cofounders - John Fanning - who loved the concept and offered to help raise a greater seed round however we didn’t pursue as he was pushing us towards usage in sports and other industries we had no real interest for.",

      "solution": [
        {"id": 0, "paragraph": "As I achieved increasingly cool projects and for professional development reasons I felt the need to have an online presence showcasing my work. At home for two weeks I sat down and solved this like a design sprint. I could have simply used some of the portfolio services out there but wanted to hone my front end web development skills so I spent some time browsing the web for some cool tools to learn. I knew Node JS and ejs template rendering and was looking for an intuitive framework to pair with. I had heard of React though it seemed scary and too big to master through a two weeks project. However, after reading the docs and watching some videos on YouTube it didn’t seem scary anymore and I went for it."},
        {"id": 1, "paragraph": "First, I made a physical layout of it using post-its to represent the different reusable components. Then I went to Sketch and stripped down the layout to its bare essentials and to fit a mobile phone display. I used sass as it was more intuitive coming from a javascript perspective (I hate css.) I built the full layout for mobile screen size and enabled server render first. I read tons of documentation to make sure my React architecture was clean and stable. Then I gradually scaled with more elements and extended the layout on the viewport through media queries. In the ended the technical part ended up being the easiest."},
        {"id": 2, "paragraph": "The main challenge for this was probably about graphic design and typography. In fact, I wanted to make this as readable as possible due to the amount of text I have and would like to add in the future. Thus I had to research how to best size every aspects of my type, the font I should use with different title styling. Diving into information architecture was also one the things I took for granted. All the content needs to be indexed to be readable by all sorts of users from Blind text to speech engines to social medias and  Google’s search crawlers. In addition, I made some svg visuals including a favicon, a drawing of my face (made in Illustrator) and yellow parallelograms as I felt for esthetic purposes. Lastly, I built a staging server on Heroku to get feedback from my peers before publishing into to the wilderness."}
